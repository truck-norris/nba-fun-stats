# NBA Video and Gif Generator

## Description

We were tasked with creating an app that calls for API data from two different sources. We chose to pull NBA stats for each of the 30 teams and play a song for the team and/or city.

## Installation

To be updated later.

## Usage

When the user loads the page, they can choose a team from the search box and the team name will auto populate in a drop down box based on what words were used to search with. Once a team is selected, a set of gifs and a recent YouTube video will populate the screen.
